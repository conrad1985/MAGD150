# MAGD150


Hello, I am a Freshman at UW Whitewater studying game design. In the links below are my past labs from my first semester here with a coding program called processing. 

[lab01](https://github.com/conrad1985/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/F17MAGD150LAB01_ConradMustell.pde)
This was the first progect with the processing program which was mainly to get used to the program and how it works. It includes ellipses rectangles and points to create a city at night. 

[lab03](https://github.com/conrad1985/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f17_magd150_lab03_conradmustell.pde)
This was a "screen saver" that was created to get used to rounding shapes, moving them on an axis and playing with position. This piece includes ellipses, triangles, and rectangles.

[lab04](https://github.com/conrad1985/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s17magd150lab04_Mustell.pde)
For lab 04 I worked with animation as well as key pressed and mouse pressed. The theme for this piece was Pizza and by clicking the mouse or space bar, included is ellipses triangles and animation.

[lab06](https://github.com/conrad1985/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/f17magd150lab06_mustell.pde)
Lab 06 was a weather theme project and I chose to do a winter theme. Using points I created "falling snow" with a random placement of the points. Included is random point placement, ellipses, points, class, and arcs.

[lab08](https://github.com/conrad1985/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/fall17_magd150_lab08_Mustell.pde)
Lab 08 contained a movie poster that I created which I based off a game I wanted to make. Using different shades of pinks and multiple rectangels I had created a sunset with a tree off the the side. This was created using just rectangles.
